# Software Design Document: Book Exchange System

## 1. Introduction
### 1.1 Purpose
This document describes the architecture and detailed design for the Task Management System (TMS), a web-based application for team collaboration and task tracking.
### 1.2 Scope
TMS will allow users to create projects, assign tasks, track progress, and generate reports on team productivity.
### 1.3 Definitions
- TMS: Task Management System
- User: Any person with authorized access to the system
- Task: A unit of work to be completed
- Project: A collection of related tasks

## 2. System Architecture
### 2.1 High-Level Architecture
TMS follows a three-tier architecture:
- Presentation Layer (Frontend)
- Application Layer (Backend)
- Data Layer (Database)
### 2.2 Technology Stack
- Frontend: React.js, Redux, Material UI
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js
- Database: MongoDB
- Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- Deployment: Docker, AWS

## 3. Detailed Design
### 3.1 Database Schema
Users Collection
```json
JSON
{
  "_id": ObjectId,
  "username": String,
  "email": String,
  "password": String (hashed),
  "role": String (admin, manager, or member),
  "createdAt": Date,
  "updatedAt": Date
}
```
Projects Collection
```json
JSON
{
  "_id": ObjectId,
  "name": String,
  "description": String,
  "owner": ObjectId (ref: Users),
  "members": [ObjectId] (ref: Users),
  "status": String (active, completed, archived),
  "startDate": Date,
  "endDate": Date,
  "createdAt": Date,
  "updatedAt": Date
}
```
Tasks Collection
```json
JSON
{
  "_id": ObjectId,
  "title": String,
  "description": String,
  "project": ObjectId (ref: Projects),
  "assignedTo": ObjectId (ref: Users),
  "priority": String (low, medium, high),
  "status": String (todo, in-progress, review, done),
  "dueDate": Date,
  "createdAt": Date,
  "updatedAt": Date
}
```
### 3.2 API Endpoints
#### Authentication
- POST /api/auth/register - Register a new user
- POST /api/auth/login - User login
- POST /api/auth/logout - User logout
#### Users
- GET /api/users - Get all users
- GET /api/users/:id - Get user by ID
- PUT /api/users/:id - Update user
- DELETE /api/users/:id - Delete user
#### Projects
- GET /api/projects - Get all projects
- POST /api/projects - Create a new project
- GET /api/projects/:id - Get project by ID
- PUT /api/projects/:id - Update project
- DELETE /api/projects/:id - Delete project
#### Tasks
- GET /api/tasks - Get all tasks
- POST /api/tasks - Create a new task
- GET /api/tasks/:id - Get task by ID
- PUT /api/tasks/:id - Update task
- DELETE /api/tasks/:id - Delete task

## 4. User Interface Design
### 4.1 Wireframes
#### Key screens include:
- Dashboard
- Project List/Detail View
- Task List/Detail View
- User Profile
- Admin Panel
### 4.2 Navigation Structure
```
Home
├── Dashboard
├── Projects
│   ├── Project List
│   └── Project Details
├── Tasks
│   ├── My Tasks
│   ├── Team Tasks
│   └── Task Details
├── Reports
└── Settings
    ├── Profile
    ├── Notifications
    └── Team Management (Admin only)
```
## 5. Security Considerations
### 5.1 Authentication and Authorization
- JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Password hashing using bcrypt
### 5.2 Data Protection
- HTTPS for all communications
- Input validation and sanitization
- Protection against common vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF, SQL Injection)
## 6. Testing Strategy
### 6.1 Unit Testing
- Jest and React Testing Library for frontend components and utility functions.
### 6.2 Integration Testing
- API endpoint testing using Supertest.
### 6.3 End-to-End Testing
- Cypress for simulating user interactions.

## 7. Deployment Plan
### 7.1 Development Environment
- Docker containers for local development.
### 7.2 Staging Environment
- AWS ECS with CI/CD pipeline via GitHub Actions.
### 7.3 Production Environment
- AWS ECS with auto-scaling and load balancing.
