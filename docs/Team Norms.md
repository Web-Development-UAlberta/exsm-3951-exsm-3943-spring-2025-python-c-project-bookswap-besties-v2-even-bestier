## Communication & Collaboration Methods

Our primary communication tool will be a WhatsApp/Slack/Messenger group chat.  
**Members are expected to check messages at least once per day during the project** 

If a member cannot be reached via group chat, SMS and/or email will be used as a backup.

**Google Drive** (for documents) and **GitHub** (for code and version control) are the official collaboration platforms.

Asking for help early is encouraged if a member is struggling to complete assigned work by a soft deadline.  
Resolving issues internally is preferred; unresolved issues may be escalated to **Bo and James** before contacting Tech Prog
administration.

---

## Client Communication

- Any team member may communicate directly with the client.
- All written communication to the client must be proofread by another team member before being sent.
- Emails to the client must CC all team members and instructors.
- Oral communication with the client outside the group is not ideal,
  but if necessary must be documented and shared with the team and instructors.

---

## Punctuality & Attendance

**Meeting times and expectations must be confirmed at least one day prior**.

If a member will be absent or late:
- **Notify the team as early as possible** (preferably the day before, minimum 30 minutes before the meeting).
- Valid reasons include medical emergencies, unavoidable appointments, transportation issues.
- Invalid reasons include oversleeping or casual avoidance.

Members missing a meeting must review meeting notes and complete assigned tasks independently.

Failure to provide a valid reason will result in a strike.

---

## Meeting Times, Locations & Management

- Regular meetings will occur during Capstone class time Wednesday's from 7p.m. - 9p.m..
- Additional meetings may be scheduled based on project needs.

### Meeting Requirements
- Additional meetings should be scheduled at least one day in advance.
- Attendance will be clarified (required or optional) when scheduling.
- Major project decisions require approval by 2/3 of team members.
- No tasks can be assigned to a member without their consent.

Meeting details (time, location, required attendees, and task agenda) must be posted in group chat.  
Meeting cancellations must be communicated reasonably, with attempts to reach all members.

---

## Workload Expectations

**All members are expected to contribute a reasonable and equitable share of work**

- No member may refuse work and expect full project credit.
- Soft deadlines will be set for major assignments (minimum one).
- Missing a soft deadline grants **one opportunity** to correct the work before the second deadline.
- Continued failure to meet deadlines may result in **member removal**.

All student program expectations and codes of conduct apply during meetings, communications, and deliverables.

---

## Conflict Resolution

Conflicts will be handled through the following steps:
1. Team discussion to resolve the issue.
2. If unresolved, a vote will be held.
3. If a tie occurs, resolution will be decided by Rock-Paper-Scissors (best of 3 rounds).
4. The winner’s solution will be implemented.

If an issue significantly impacts the project or cannot be resolved internally, it will be escalated to **Bo and James**.  
Severe infractions will be escalated directly to Tech Program administration.

---

## Strikes Policy

A **strike** is a formal warning for failing to meet expectations.

- Strikes will be recorded in a **shared, version-controlled document**.
- Accumulating **three strikes** will result in team removal proceedings.
- Severe policy or legal violations bypass the strike system and are escalated immediately.

---

## Member Removal Policy

If removal is necessary:
1. Evidence of infractions will be gathered by the remaining members.
2. The case will be presented to **Bo and James**.
3. If approved, the member will be officially removed.
4. The member’s status will then be addressed as necessary by relevant parties.

---

## Agreement

By participating in this Capstone project, each team member agrees to:
- Follow these team norms.
- Communicate respectfully and responsibly.
- Contribute fairly to the team's workload.
- Actively support the team’s and project's success.
